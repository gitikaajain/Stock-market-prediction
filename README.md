> Using various supervised learningâ€“based models to predict the stock price of Reliance using correlated assets and its own historical data.
Furthermore, we will focus on:
* Looking at various machine learning and time series models, ranging in complexity, that can
be used to predict stock returns.
* Visualization of the data using different kinds of charts (i.e., density, correlation, scatterplot,
etc.).
* Using deep learning (LSTM) models for time series forecasting.
